            <h3>Established in 2024</h3>
            <p>
              AIGENTIC Compliance was founded in 2024 with a clear ambition: to
              revolutionize the way organizations approach compliance. After
              years of working in corporate compliance roles, our founder
              experienced first-hand how expensive, complex systems, fragmented
              policies, and uninspired training failed both employees and
              compliance officers. Compliance was seen as a burdenâ€”expensive,
              inefficient, and disconnected from real behavior. <br>We believed
              there had to be a better way.
            </p>

          <div class="purple-box" data-aos="fade-left">
            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
            <p>
              Our mission is bold: to turn compliance into a catalyst for
              culture, trust, and long-term business integrity. Weâ€™re building
              the worldâ€™s first truly intelligent compliance platformâ€”one that
              learns, adapts, and empowers employees and compliance officers
              alike through real-time guidance, policy intelligence, and
              immersive training. <br><br>Driven by Agentic AI, powered by human
              insight, and designed for the real world.
